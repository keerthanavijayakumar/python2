<html>
<body>
<script>
var a = new Date('2013-11-05');
var b = new Date('2013-11-05');
Then, you want to compare them, so you would probably think this code will print "a equals b":

if(a == b) {
	document.write("a equals b");
} 
else {
	document.write("a NOT equals b");
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
