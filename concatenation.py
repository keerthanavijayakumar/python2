# Python String Operations
string1 =input("ENTER FIRST STRING:")
string2 =input("ENTER SECOND STRING:")

# using +
print('CONCATENATION OF TWO STRINGS = ', string1 + string2)

# using *
print('string1 * 5 =', string1 * 5)
print('string2 * 3 =', string1 * 3)




#Notes:
    
#Joining of two or more strings into a single one is called concatenation.

##The + operator does this in Python. Simply writing two string literals together also concatenates them.

#The * operator can be used to repeat the string for a given number of times.
